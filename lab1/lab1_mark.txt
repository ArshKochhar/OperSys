Comments:
The code did not compile (error in line 351: you should not declare "int i" inside for loop
since you are using c language not cpp. The documentations are good, but a little short. 
I suggest you to follow these instructions if you also want to get the full mark for future labs.


	
1. 	Currently, you have included few lines of comments available in your code. 
	However, the comments should follow the examples provided for "all" functions. i.e. start 
	with \\+ and end with \\- and include "purpose", "Parameters", and "function".
	
2.	Using "script" command to make the testing docs is good. However, the explanaitions 
	were very short and limited, especially for part 2. Your tests were not very clear as well.
	
3.	Although I could not compile your codes, it's clear that your implementation of 'ls' is not 
	complete. Also "free" on line 296 is not releasing anything. Finally, you are not calling doCommand in your
	main, therefore I am not sure how you managed to get the results in your tests. I speculate that the tests were
	performed in the default linux environment.
